SanQi, the world traveler! Born in Taipei, he embarked on a transcontinental journey to the U.S. at just two months old. The very next day, he set off to the Great Smoky Mountains, ready to witness the magical fall colors.

He even attended "kinderdog" school to learn how to get along with everyone. And guess what? He graduated with flying colors!

SanQi is a social butterflyâ€”he loves making new friends, whether it's people, kids, dogs, or even insects! He smiles incessantly, although his breath might make you question that decision.

But be warned, even SanQi has his gloomy days. There was this one time when he decided to take a nap with his eyes hidden under a drawer leg. I kid you not, it was both hilarious and adorable!

And oh, he can be quite stubborn too. He has his own thoughts and routes, pretending not to listen to you.

So there you have it, the mischievous yet utterly lovable SanQi. He's a dog of many quirks and tales, adding joy and laughter to my life every day.
