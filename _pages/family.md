SanQi, the world traveler! Born in Taipei, he embarked on a transcontinental journey to the U.S. at just two months old. The very next day, he set off to the Great Smoky Mountains, ready to witness the magical fall colors. ![Fall Colors](/assets/img/fallcolor.jpg)

He even attended "kinderdog" school to learn how to get along with everyone. And guess what? He graduated with flying colors! ![Graduation](/assets/img/graduation.jpg)

SanQi is a social butterflyâ€”he loves making new friends, whether it's people, kids, dogs, or even insects! He smiles incessantly, although his breath might make you question that decision. ![Infectious Smile](/assets/img/smile.jpg)

But be warned, even SanQi has his gloomy days. There was this one time when he decided to take a nap with his eyes hidden under a drawer leg. I kid you not, it was both hilarious and adorable! ![Funny Nap](/assets/img/sleep.jpeg)

And oh, he can be quite stubborn too. He has his own thoughts and routes, pretending not to listen to you. ![Stubborn](/assets/img/stubborn.jpg)

So there you have it, the mischievous yet utterly lovable SanQi. He's a dog of many quirks and tales, adding joy and laughter to my life every day.
