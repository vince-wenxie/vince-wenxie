Hi, I'm Wen, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer and Eletrical Engineering from UH. I am passionate about conducting marketing research that combines machine learning (ML), big data analytics, and theoretical and statistical analyses to solve practical problems and guide business decisions. My research interests lie at the intersection of visual marketing, online advertising, social media, and machine learning.
