Hi, I'm Wen, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer and Electrical Engineering at University of Houston. I leverage machine learning and big data analytics to conduct marketing research and address substantive problems for business implications. My research interests lie at the intersection of visual marketing, online advertising, social media, causal analysis, computer vision, and natural language processing. 

<span style="color: red">I'm currently seeking opportunities as a postdoctoral fellow or Assistant Professor in the field of Marketing.</span> Additionally, I am also interested in pursuing full-time roles as an applied scientist, research scientist, machine learning engineer, or data scientist. I would greatly appreciate any resources or referrals that can help me in my search.

Please contact me via email [vaneshieh@gmail.com](mailto:vaneshieh@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincexie/)
