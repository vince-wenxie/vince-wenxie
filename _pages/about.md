Hi, I'm Wen, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer and Electrical Engineering at University of Houston. I am passionate about leveraging machine learning and big data analytics to conduct marketing research and address substantive problems and practical challenges for business implications. My research interests lie at the intersection of visual marketing, online advertising, social media, causal analysis, computer vision, and natural language processing.
